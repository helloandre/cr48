# This file returns the 26 code points in Unicode Version 5.2.0 that match
# any of the following regular expression constructs:
# 
#         \p{Sentence_Break=SContinue}
#         \p{SB=SC}
#         \p{Is_Sentence_Break=SContinue}
#         \p{Is_SB=SC}
# 
# perluniprops.pod should be consulted for the syntax rules for any of these,
# including if adding or subtracting white space, underscore, and hyphen
# characters matters or doesn't matter, and other permissible syntactic
# variants.  Upper/lower case distinctions never matter.
# 
# A colon can be substituted for the equals sign, and anything to the left of
# the equals (or colon) can be combined with anything to the right.  Thus,
# for example,
#         \p{Is_SB: SContinue}
# is also valid.
# 
# The format of the lines of this file is: START\tSTOP\twhere START is the
# starting code point of the range, in hex; STOP is the ending point, or if
# omitted, the range has just one code point.  Numbers in comments in
# [brackets] indicate how many code points are in the range.

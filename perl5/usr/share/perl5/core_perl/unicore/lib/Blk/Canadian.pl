#         \p{Block=Unified_Canadian_Aboriginal_Syllabics}

# perluniprops.pod should be consulted for the syntax rules for any of these,

# 
# A colon can be substituted for the equals sign, and anything to the left of
# the equals (or colon) can be combined with anything to the right.  Thus,
# for example,
#         \p{Is_Blk: Unified_Canadian_Aboriginal_Syllabics}
# is also valid.
# 
# The format of the lines of this file is: START\tSTOP\twhere START is the
# starting code point of the range, in hex; STOP is the ending point, or if
# omitted, the range has just one code point.  Numbers in comments in
# [brackets] indicate how many code points are in the range.

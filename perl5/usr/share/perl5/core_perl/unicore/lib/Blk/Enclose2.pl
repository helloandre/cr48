# This file returns the 256 code points in Unicode Version 5.2.0 that match
# any of the following regular expression constructs:
# 
#         \p{Block=Enclosed_CJK_Letters_And_Months}
#         \p{Blk=Enclosed_CJK_Letters_And_Months}
#         \p{Is_Block=Enclosed_CJK_Letters_And_Months}

#         \p{In_Enclosed_CJK_Letters_And_Months}

# perluniprops.pod should be consulted for the syntax rules for any of these,

# variants.  Upper/lower case distinctions never matter.
# 
# A colon can be substituted for the equals sign, and anything to the left of
# the equals (or colon) can be combined with anything to the right.  Thus,
# for example,
#         \p{Is_Blk: Enclosed_CJK_Letters_And_Months}
# is also valid.
# 
# The format of the lines of this file is: START\tSTOP\twhere START is the
# starting code point of the range, in hex; STOP is the ending point, or if
# omitted, the range has just one code point.  Numbers in comments in
# [brackets] indicate how many code points are in the range.

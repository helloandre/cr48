Synopsis
--------
**hg** *command* [*option*]... [*argument*]...

Description
-----------
The **hg** command provides a command line interface to the Mercurial
system.

Command Elements
----------------

files...
    indicates one or more filename or relative path filenames; see
    `File Name Patterns`_ for information on pattern matching

path
    indicates a path on the local machine

revision
    indicates a changeset which can be specified as a changeset
    revision number, a tag, or a unique substring of the changeset
    hash value

repository path
    either the pathname of a local repository or the URI of a remote
    repository.

.. include:: hg.1.gendoc.txt

Files
-----

``.hgignore``
    This file contains regular expressions (one per line) that
    describe file names that should be ignored by **hg**. For details,
    see |hgignore(5)|_.

``.hgtags``
    This file contains changeset hash values and text tag names (one
    of each separated by spaces) that correspond to tagged versions of
    the repository contents.

``/etc/mercurial/hgrc``, ``$HOME/.hgrc``, ``.hg/hgrc``
    This file contains defaults and configuration. Values in
    ``.hg/hgrc`` override those in ``$HOME/.hgrc``, and these override
    settings made in the global ``/etc/mercurial/hgrc`` configuration.
    See |hgrc(5)|_ for details of the contents and format of these
    files.

Some commands (e.g. revert) produce backup files ending in ``.orig``,
if the ``.orig`` file already exists and is not tracked by Mercurial,
it will be overwritten.

Bugs
----
Probably lots, please post them to the mailing list (see Resources_
below) when you find them.

Put here definitions of blacklists for run-tests.py

Create a file per blacklist. Each file should list the names of tests that you
want to be skipped.
File names are meant to be used as targets for run-tests.py --blacklist
option.
Lines starting with # are ignored. White spaces are stripped.

e.g. if you create a blacklist/example file containing:
 test-hgrc
 # some comment
 test-help
then calling "run-tests.py --blacklist blacklists/example" will exclude
test-hgrc and test-help from the list of tests to run.

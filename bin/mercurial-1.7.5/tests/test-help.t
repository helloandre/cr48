  $ hg help verify
  hg verify
  
  verify the integrity of the repository
  
      Verify the integrity of the current repository.
  
      This will perform an extensive check of the repository's integrity,
      validating the hashes and checksums of each entry in the changelog,
      manifest, and tracked files, as well as the integrity of their crosslinks
      and indices.
  
      Returns 0 on success, 1 if errors are encountered.
  
  use "hg -v help verify" to show global options

  $ hg help diff
  hg diff [OPTION]... ([-c REV] | [-r REV1 [-r REV2]]) [FILE]...
  
  diff repository (or selected files)
  
      Show differences between revisions for the specified files.
  
      Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.
  
      Note:
         diff may generate unexpected results for merges, as it will default to
         comparing against the working directory's first parent changeset if no
         revisions are specified.
  
      When two revision arguments are given, then changes are shown between
      those revisions. If only one revision is specified then that revision is
      compared to the working directory, and, when no revisions are specified,
      the working directory files are compared to its parent.
  
      Alternatively you can specify -c/--change with a revision to see the
      changes in that changeset relative to its first parent.
  
      Without the -a/--text option, diff will avoid generating diffs of files it
      detects as binary. With -a, diff will generate a diff anyway, probably
      with undesirable results.
  
      Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff format.
      For more information, read "hg help diffs".
  
      Returns 0 on success.
  
  options:
  
   -r --rev REV [+]          revision
   -c --change REV           change made by revision
   -a --text                 treat all files as text
   -g --git                  use git extended diff format
      --nodates              omit dates from diff headers
   -p --show-function        show which function each change is in
      --reverse              produce a diff that undoes the changes
   -w --ignore-all-space     ignore white space when comparing lines
   -b --ignore-space-change  ignore changes in the amount of white space
   -B --ignore-blank-lines   ignore changes whose lines are all blank
   -U --unified NUM          number of lines of context to show
      --stat                 output diffstat-style summary of changes
   -I --include PATTERN [+]  include names matching the given patterns
   -X --exclude PATTERN [+]  exclude names matching the given patterns

  $ hg help status
  hg status [OPTION]... [FILE]...
  
  aliases: st
  
  show changed files in the working directory
  
      Show status of files in the repository. If names are given, only files
      that match are shown. Files that are clean or ignored or the source of a
      copy/move operation, are not listed unless -c/--clean, -i/--ignored,
      -C/--copies or -A/--all are given. Unless options described with "show
      only ..." are given, the options -mardu are used.
  
      Option -q/--quiet hides untracked (unknown and ignored) files unless
      explicitly requested with -u/--unknown or -i/--ignored.
  
      Note:
         status may appear to disagree with diff if permissions have changed or
         a merge has occurred. The standard diff format does not report
         permission changes and diff only reports changes relative to one merge
         parent.
  
      If one revision is given, it is used as the base revision. If two
      revisions are given, the differences between them are shown. The --change
      option can also be used as a shortcut to list the changed files of a
      revision from its first parent.
  
      The codes used to show the status of files are:
  
        M = modified
        A = added
        R = removed
        C = clean
        ! = missing (deleted by non-hg command, but still tracked)
        ? = not tracked
        I = ignored
          = origin of the previous file listed as A (added)
  
      Returns 0 on success.
  
  options:
  
   -A --all                  show status of all files
   -m --modified             show only modified files
   -a --added                show only added files
   -r --removed              show only removed files
   -d --deleted              show only deleted (but tracked) files
   -c --clean                show only files without changes
   -u --unknown              show only unknown (not tracked) files
   -i --ignored              show only ignored files
   -n --no-status            hide status prefix
   -C --copies               show source of copied files
   -0 --print0               end filenames with NUL, for use with xargs
      --rev REV [+]          show difference from revision
      --change REV           list the changed files of a revision
   -I --include PATTERN [+]  include names matching the given patterns
   -X --exclude PATTERN [+]  exclude names matching the given patterns

  $ hg help revs
  Specifying Single Revisions
  
      Mercurial supports several ways to specify individual revisions.
  
      A plain integer is treated as a revision number. Negative integers are
      treated as sequential offsets from the tip, with -1 denoting the tip, -2
      denoting the revision prior to the tip, and so forth.
  
      A 40-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique revision identifier.
  
      A hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is treated as a unique
      revision identifier and is referred to as a short-form identifier. A
      short-form identifier is only valid if it is the prefix of exactly one
      full-length identifier.
  
      Any other string is treated as a tag or branch name. A tag name is a
      symbolic name associated with a revision identifier. A branch name denotes
      the tipmost revision of that branch. Tag and branch names must not contain
      the ":" character.
  
      The reserved name "tip" is a special tag that always identifies the most
      recent revision.
  
      The reserved name "null" indicates the null revision. This is the revision
      of an empty repository, and the parent of revision 0.
  
      The reserved name "." indicates the working directory parent. If no
      working directory is checked out, it is equivalent to null. If an
      uncommitted merge is in progress, "." is the revision of the first parent.

literals formatted to fit within 60 characters:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The fully minimized form is the most convenient form:

  Hello
    literal
      world

In the partially minimized form a paragraph simply ends with
space-double-colon.

  ////////////////////////////////////////
  long un-wrapped line in a literal block
  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

  This literal block is started with '::',
    the so-called expanded form. The paragraph
      with '::' disappears in the final output.

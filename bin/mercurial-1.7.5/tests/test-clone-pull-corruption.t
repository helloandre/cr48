Create two repos, so that one of them can pull from the other one.

  $ hg init source
  $ cd source
  $ touch foo
  $ hg add foo
  $ hg ci -m 'add foo'
  $ hg clone . ../corrupted
  updating to branch default
  1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
  $ echo >> foo
  $ hg ci -m 'change foo'

  $ cd ../corrupted
  $ echo '[hooks]' >> .hg/hgrc
  $ echo 'pretxncommit = sleep 5; exit 1' >> .hg/hgrc

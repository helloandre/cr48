In theory, we shouldn't need the "-y" below, but it prevents this test
from hanging when "hg update" erroneously prompts the user for "keep
or delete".

Should abort:

  $ hg update -y 1
  abort: crosses branches (merge branches or use --clean to discard changes)
  [255]
  $ mv c a

Should succeed:

  $ hg update -y 1
  1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved

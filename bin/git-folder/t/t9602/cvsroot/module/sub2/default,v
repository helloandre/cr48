log
@A single commit affecting one file on branch B_MIXED and one on trunk.
@
text
@This is sub2/default.

Every directory in the `proj' project has a file named `default'.

This line was added in the second commit (affecting all 7 files).

The same commit added these two lines here on trunk, and two similar
lines to ./branch_B_MIXED_only on branch B_MIXED.

This change excludes sub3/default, because it was not part of this
commit, and sub1/subsubB/default, which is not even on the branch yet.

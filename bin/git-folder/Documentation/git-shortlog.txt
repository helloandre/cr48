NAME
----
git-shortlog - Summarize 'git log' output

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
git log --pretty=short | 'git shortlog' [-h] [-n] [-s] [-e] [-w]
'git shortlog' [-n|--numbered] [-s|--summary] [-e|--email] [-w[<width>[,<indent1>[,<indent2>]]]] <commit>...

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Summarizes 'git log' output in a format suitable for inclusion
in release announcements. Each commit will be grouped by author and
the first line of the commit message will be shown.

Additionally, "[PATCH]" will be stripped from the commit description.

If no revisions are passed on the command line and either standard input
is not a terminal or there is no current branch, 'git shortlog' will
output a summary of the log read from standard input, without
reference to the current repository.

OPTIONS
-------

-h::
--help::
	Print a short usage message and exit.

-n::
--numbered::
	Sort output according to the number of commits per author instead
	of author alphabetic order.

-s::
--summary::
	Suppress commit description and provide a commit count summary only.

-e::
--email::
	Show the email address of each author.

--format[=<format>]::
	Instead of the commit subject, use some other information to
	describe each commit.  '<format>' can be any string accepted
	by the `--format` option of 'git log', such as '{asterisk} [%h] %s'.
	(See the "PRETTY FORMATS" section of linkgit:git-log[1].)

	Each pretty-printed commit will be rewrapped before it is shown.

-w[<width>[,<indent1>[,<indent2>]]]::
	Linewrap the output by wrapping each line at `width`.  The first
	line of each entry is indented by `indent1` spaces, and the second
	and subsequent lines are indented by `indent2` spaces. `width`,
	`indent1`, and `indent2` default to 76, 6 and 9 respectively.


MAPPING AUTHORS
---------------

The `.mailmap` feature is used to coalesce together commits by the same
person in the shortlog, where their name and/or email address was
spelled differently.

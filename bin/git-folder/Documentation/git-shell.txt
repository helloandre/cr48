NAME
----
git-shell - Restricted login shell for Git-only SSH access


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git shell' [-c <command> <argument>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

A login shell for SSH accounts to provide restricted Git access. When
'-c' is given, the program executes <command> non-interactively;
<command> can be one of 'git receive-pack', 'git upload-pack', 'git
upload-archive', 'cvs server', or a command in COMMAND_DIR. The shell
is started in interactive mode when no arguments are given; in this
case, COMMAND_DIR must exist, and any of the executables in it can be
invoked.

'cvs server' is a special command which executes git-cvsserver.

COMMAND_DIR is the path "$HOME/git-shell-commands". The user must have
read and execute permissions to the directory in order to execute the
programs in it. The programs are executed with a cwd of $HOME, and
<argument> is parsed as a command-line string.

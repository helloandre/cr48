==================

NAME
----
git-hash-object - Compute object ID and optionally creates a blob from a file


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git hash-object' [-t <type>] [-w] [--path=<file>|--no-filters] [--stdin] [--] <file>...
'git hash-object' [-t <type>] [-w] --stdin-paths [--no-filters] < <list-of-paths>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Computes the object ID value for an object with specified type
with the contents of the named file (which can be outside of the
work tree), and optionally writes the resulting object into the
object database.  Reports its object ID to its standard output.
This is used by 'git cvsimport' to update the index
without modifying files in the work tree.  When <type> is not
specified, it defaults to "blob".

OPTIONS
-------

-t <type>::
	Specify the type (default: "blob").

-w::
	Actually write the object into the object database.

--stdin::
	Read the object from standard input instead of from a file.

--stdin-paths::
	Read file names from stdin instead of from the command-line.

--path::
	Hash object as it were located at the given path. The location of
	file does not directly influence on the hash value, but path is
	used to determine what git filters should be applied to the object
	before it can be placed to the object database, and, as result of
	applying filters, the actual blob put into the object database may
	differ from the given file. This option is mainly useful for hashing
	temporary files located outside of the working directory or files
	read from stdin.

--no-filters::
	Hash the contents as is, ignoring any input filter that would
	have been chosen by the attributes mechanism, including the end-of-line
	conversion. If the file is read from standard input then this
	is always implied, unless the --path option is given.

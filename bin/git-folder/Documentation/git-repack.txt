NAME
----
git-repack - Pack unpacked objects in a repository


SYNOPSIS
--------
'git repack' [-a] [-A] [-d] [-f] [-F] [-l] [-n] [-q] [--window=<n>] [--depth=<n>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This script is used to combine all objects that do not currently
reside in a "pack", into a pack.  It can also be used to re-organize
existing packs into a single, more efficient pack.

A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with
delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an
associated index file.

Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup
engines, disk storage, etc.

OPTIONS
-------

-a::
	Instead of incrementally packing the unpacked objects,
	pack everything referenced into a single pack.
	Especially useful when packing a repository that is used
	for private development. Use
	with '-d'.  This will clean up the objects that `git prune`
	leaves behind, but `git fsck --full` shows as
	dangling.
+
Note that users fetching over dumb protocols will have to fetch the
whole new pack in order to get any contained object, no matter how many
other objects in that pack they already have locally.

-A::
	Same as `-a`, unless '-d' is used.  Then any unreachable
	objects in a previous pack become loose, unpacked objects,
	instead of being left in the old pack.  Unreachable objects
	are never intentionally added to a pack, even when repacking.
	This option prevents unreachable objects from being immediately
	deleted by way of being left in the old pack and then
	removed.  Instead, the loose unreachable objects
	will be pruned according to normal expiry rules
	with the next 'git gc' invocation. See linkgit:git-gc[1].

-d::
	After packing, if the newly created packs make some
	existing packs redundant, remove the redundant packs.
	Also run  'git prune-packed' to remove redundant
	loose object files.

-l::
	Pass the `--local` option to 'git pack-objects'. See
	linkgit:git-pack-objects[1].

-f::
	Pass the `--no-reuse-delta` option to `git-pack-objects`, see
	linkgit:git-pack-objects[1].

-F::
	Pass the `--no-reuse-object` option to `git-pack-objects`, see
	linkgit:git-pack-objects[1].

-q::
	Pass the `-q` option to 'git pack-objects'. See
	linkgit:git-pack-objects[1].

-n::
	Do not update the server information with
	'git update-server-info'.  This option skips
	updating local catalog files needed to publish
	this repository (or a direct copy of it)
	over HTTP or FTP.  See linkgit:git-update-server-info[1].

--window=<n>::
--depth=<n>::
	These two options affect how the objects contained in the pack are
	stored using delta compression. The objects are first internally
	sorted by type, size and optionally names and compared against the
	other objects within `--window` to see if using delta compression saves
	space. `--depth` limits the maximum delta depth; making it too deep
	affects the performance on the unpacker side, because delta data needs
	to be applied that many times to get to the necessary object.
	The default value for --window is 10 and --depth is 50.

--window-memory=<n>::
	This option provides an additional limit on top of `--window`;
	the window size will dynamically scale down so as to not take
	up more than '<n>' bytes in memory.  This is useful in
	repositories with a mix of large and small objects to not run
	out of memory with a large window, but still be able to take
	advantage of the large window for the smaller objects.  The
	size can be suffixed with "k", "m", or "g".
	`--window-memory=0` makes memory usage unlimited, which is the
	default.

--max-pack-size=<n>::
	Maximum size of each output pack file. The size can be suffixed with
	"k", "m", or "g". The minimum size allowed is limited to 1 MiB.
	If specified,  multiple packfiles may be created.
	The default is unlimited, unless the config variable
	`pack.packSizeLimit` is set.


Configuration
-------------

By default, the command passes `--delta-base-offset` option to
'git pack-objects'; this typically results in slightly smaller packs,
but the generated packs are incompatible with versions of Git older than
version 1.4.4. If you need to share your repository with such ancient Git
versions, either directly or via the dumb http or rsync protocol, then you
need to set the configuration variable `repack.UseDeltaBaseOffset` to
"false" and repack. Access from old Git versions over the native protocol
is unaffected by this option as the conversion is performed on the fly
as needed in that case.

:git-diff-core: 1
endif::git-log[]
endif::git-diff[]
endif::git-format-patch[]

ifdef::git-format-patch[]
-p::
--no-stat::
	Generate plain patches without any diffstats.
endif::git-format-patch[]

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
-p::
-u::
--patch::
	Generate patch (see section on generating patches).
	{git-diff? This is the default.}
endif::git-format-patch[]

-U<n>::
--unified=<n>::
	Generate diffs with <n> lines of context instead of
	the usual three.
ifndef::git-format-patch[]
	Implies `-p`.
endif::git-format-patch[]

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--raw::
	Generate the raw format.
	{git-diff-core? This is the default.}
endif::git-format-patch[]

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--patch-with-raw::
	Synonym for `-p --raw`.
endif::git-format-patch[]

--patience::
	Generate a diff using the "patience diff" algorithm.

--stat[=<width>[,<name-width>]]::
	Generate a diffstat.  You can override the default
	output width for 80-column terminal by `--stat=<width>`.
	The width of the filename part can be controlled by
	giving another width to it separated by a comma.

--numstat::
	Similar to `\--stat`, but shows number of added and
	deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without
	abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly.  For
	binary files, outputs two `-` instead of saying
	`0 0`.

--shortstat::
	Output only the last line of the `--stat` format containing total
	number of modified files, as well as number of added and deleted
	lines.

--dirstat[=<limit>]::
	Output the distribution of relative amount of changes (number of lines added or
	removed) for each sub-directory. Directories with changes below
	a cut-off percent (3% by default) are not shown. The cut-off percent
	can be set with `--dirstat=<limit>`. Changes in a child directory are not
	counted for the parent directory, unless `--cumulative` is used.

--dirstat-by-file[=<limit>]::
	Same as `--dirstat`, but counts changed files instead of lines.

--summary::
	Output a condensed summary of extended header information
	such as creations, renames and mode changes.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--patch-with-stat::
	Synonym for `-p --stat`.
endif::git-format-patch[]

ifndef::git-format-patch[]

-z::
ifdef::git-log[]
	Separate the commits with NULs instead of with new newlines.
+
Also, when `--raw` or `--numstat` has been given, do not munge
pathnames and use NULs as output field terminators.
endif::git-log[]
ifndef::git-log[]
	When `--raw`, `--numstat`, `--name-only` or `--name-status` has been
	given, do not munge pathnames and use NULs as output field terminators.
endif::git-log[]
+
Without this option, each pathname output will have TAB, LF, double quotes,
and backslash characters replaced with `\t`, `\n`, `\"`, and `\\`,
respectively, and the pathname will be enclosed in double quotes if
any of those replacements occurred.

--name-only::
	Show only names of changed files.

--name-status::
	Show only names and status of changed files. See the description
	of the `--diff-filter` option on what the status letters mean.

--submodule[=<format>]::
	Chose the output format for submodule differences. <format> can be one of
	'short' and 'log'. 'short' just shows pairs of commit names, this format
	is used when this option is not given. 'log' is the default value for this
	option and lists the commits in that commit range like the 'summary'
	option of linkgit:git-submodule[1] does.

--color[=<when>]::
	Show colored diff.
	The value must be always (the default), never, or auto.

--no-color::
	Turn off colored diff, even when the configuration file
	gives the default to color output.
	Same as `--color=never`.

--word-diff[=<mode>]::
	Show a word diff, using the <mode> to delimit changed words.
	By default, words are delimited by whitespace; see
	`--word-diff-regex` below.  The <mode> defaults to 'plain', and
	must be one of:
+
--
color::
	Highlight changed words using only colors.  Implies `--color`.
plain::
	Show words as `[-removed-]` and `{+added+}`.  Makes no
	attempts to escape the delimiters if they appear in the input,
	so the output may be ambiguous.
porcelain::
	Use a special line-based format intended for script
	consumption.  Added/removed/unchanged runs are printed in the
	usual unified diff format, starting with a `+`/`-`/` `
	character at the beginning of the line and extending to the
	end of the line.  Newlines in the input are represented by a
	tilde `~` on a line of its own.
none::
	Disable word diff again.
--
+
Note that despite the name of the first mode, color is used to
highlight the changed parts in all modes if enabled.

--word-diff-regex=<regex>::
	Use <regex> to decide what a word is, instead of considering
	runs of non-whitespace to be a word.  Also implies
	`--word-diff` unless it was already enabled.
+
Every non-overlapping match of the
<regex> is considered a word.  Anything between these matches is
considered whitespace and ignored(!) for the purposes of finding
differences.  You may want to append `|[^[:space:]]` to your regular
expression to make sure that it matches all non-whitespace characters.
A match that contains a newline is silently truncated(!) at the
newline.
+
The regex can also be set via a diff driver or configuration option, see
linkgit:gitattributes[1] or linkgit:git-config[1].  Giving it explicitly
overrides any diff driver or configuration setting.  Diff drivers
override configuration settings.

--color-words[=<regex>]::
	Equivalent to `--word-diff=color` plus (if a regex was
	specified) `--word-diff-regex=<regex>`.
endif::git-format-patch[]

--no-renames::
	Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration
	file gives the default to do so.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--check::
	Warn if changes introduce trailing whitespace
	or an indent that uses a space before a tab. Exits with
	non-zero status if problems are found. Not compatible with
	--exit-code.
endif::git-format-patch[]

--full-index::
	Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full
	pre- and post-image blob object names on the "index"
	line when generating patch format output.

--binary::
	In addition to `--full-index`, output a binary diff that
	can be applied with `git-apply`.

--abbrev[=<n>]::
	Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object
	name in diff-raw format output and diff-tree header
	lines, show only a partial prefix.  This is
	independent of the `--full-index` option above, which controls
	the diff-patch output format.  Non default number of
	digits can be specified with `--abbrev=<n>`.

-B[<n>][/<m>]::
--break-rewrites[=[<n>][/<m>]]::
	Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and
	create. This serves two purposes:
+
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file
not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very
few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a
single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of
everything new, and the number `m` controls this aspect of the -B
option (defaults to 60%). `-B/70%` specifies that less than 30% of the
original should remain in the result for git to consider it a total
rewrite (i.e. otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of
deletion and insertion mixed together with context lines).
+
When used with -M, a totally-rewritten file is also considered as the
source of a rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared
as the source of a rename), and the number `n` controls this aspect of
the -B option (defaults to 50%). `-B20%` specifies that a change with
addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file's size are
eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to
another file.

-M[<n>]::
--find-renames[=<n>]::
ifndef::git-log[]
	Detect renames.
endif::git-log[]
ifdef::git-log[]
	If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each commit.
	For following files across renames while traversing history, see
	`--follow`.
endif::git-log[]
	If `n` is specified, it is a is a threshold on the similarity
	index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared to the
	file's size). For example, `-M90%` means git should consider a
	delete/add pair to be a rename if more than 90% of the file
	hasn't changed.

-C[<n>]::
--find-copies[=<n>]::
	Detect copies as well as renames.  See also `--find-copies-harder`.
	If `n` is specified, it has the same meaning as for `-M<n>`.

--find-copies-harder::
	For performance reasons, by default, `-C` option finds copies only
	if the original file of the copy was modified in the same
	changeset.  This flag makes the command
	inspect unmodified files as candidates for the source of
	copy.  This is a very expensive operation for large
	projects, so use it with caution.  Giving more than one
	`-C` option has the same effect.

-l<num>::
	The `-M` and `-C` options require O(n^2) processing time where n
	is the number of potential rename/copy targets.  This
	option prevents rename/copy detection from running if
	the number of rename/copy targets exceeds the specified
	number.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--diff-filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)...[*]]::
	Select only files that are Added (`A`), Copied (`C`),
	Deleted (`D`), Modified (`M`), Renamed (`R`), have their
	type (i.e. regular file, symlink, submodule, ...) changed (`T`),
	are Unmerged (`U`), are
	Unknown (`X`), or have had their pairing Broken (`B`).
	Any combination of the filter characters (including none) can be used.
	When `*` (All-or-none) is added to the combination, all
	paths are selected if there is any file that matches
	other criteria in the comparison; if there is no file
	that matches other criteria, nothing is selected.

-S<string>::
	Look for differences that introduce or remove an instance of
	<string>. Note that this is different than the string simply
	appearing in diff output; see the 'pickaxe' entry in
	linkgit:gitdiffcore[7] for more details.

-G<regex>::
	Look for differences whose added or removed line matches
	the given <regex>.

--pickaxe-all::
	When `-S` or `-G` finds a change, show all the changes in that
	changeset, not just the files that contain the change
	in <string>.

--pickaxe-regex::
	Make the <string> not a plain string but an extended POSIX
	regex to match.
endif::git-format-patch[]

-O<orderfile>::
	Output the patch in the order specified in the
	<orderfile>, which has one shell glob pattern per line.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
-R::
	Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or
	on-disk file to tree contents.

--relative[=<path>]::
	When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be
	told to exclude changes outside the directory and show
	pathnames relative to it with this option.  When you are
	not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a bare repository), you
	can name which subdirectory to make the output relative
	to by giving a <path> as an argument.
endif::git-format-patch[]

-a::
--text::
	Treat all files as text.

--ignore-space-at-eol::
	Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.

-b::
--ignore-space-change::
	Ignore changes in amount of whitespace.  This ignores whitespace
	at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or
	more whitespace characters to be equivalent.

-w::
--ignore-all-space::
	Ignore whitespace when comparing lines.  This ignores
	differences even if one line has whitespace where the other
	line has none.

--inter-hunk-context=<lines>::
	Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified number
	of lines, thereby fusing hunks that are close to each other.

ifndef::git-format-patch[]
--exit-code::
	Make the program exit with codes similar to diff(1).
	That is, it exits with 1 if there were differences and
	0 means no differences.

--quiet::
	Disable all output of the program. Implies `--exit-code`.
endif::git-format-patch[]

--ext-diff::
	Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set an
	external diff driver with linkgit:gitattributes[5], you need
	to use this option with linkgit:git-log[1] and friends.

--no-ext-diff::
	Disallow external diff drivers.

--ignore-submodules[=<when>]::
	Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation. <when> can be
	either "none", "untracked", "dirty" or "all", which is the default
	Using "none" will consider the submodule modified when it either contains
	untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded
	in the superproject and can be used to override any settings of the
	'ignore' option in linkgit:git-config[1] or linkgit:gitmodules[5]. When
	"untracked" is used submodules are not considered dirty when they only
	contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified
	content). Using "dirty" ignores all changes to the work tree of submodules,
	only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are shown (this was
	the behavior until 1.7.0). Using "all" hides all changes to submodules.

--src-prefix=<prefix>::
	Show the given source prefix instead of "a/".

--dst-prefix=<prefix>::
	Show the given destination prefix instead of "b/".

--no-prefix::
	Do not show any source or destination prefix.

For more detailed explanation on these common options, see also
linkgit:gitdiffcore[7].

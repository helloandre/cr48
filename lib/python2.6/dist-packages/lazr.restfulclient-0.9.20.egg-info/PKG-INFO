        NEWS for lazr.restfulclient
        ===========================
        
        0.9.20 (2010-06-25)
        ===================
        
         - It's now possible to pass a relative URL (relative to the versioned
           service root) into load().
        
        0.9.19 (2010-06-21)
        ===================
        
         - When the representation of a resource, as retrieved from the
           server, is of a different type than expected, the server value now
           takes precedence. This means that, in rare situations, a resource
           may start out presumed to be of one type, and change its
           capabilities once its representation is fetched from the server.
        
        0.9.18 (2010-06-16)
        ===================
        
         - Made it possible to avoid fetching a representation of every single
           object looked up from a CollectionWithKeyBasedLookup (by defining
           .collection_of on the class), potentially improving script
           performance.
        
        0.9.17 (2010-05-10)
        ===================
        
         - Switched back to asking for compression using the standard
           Accept-Encoding header. Using the TE header has never worked in a
           real situation due to HTTP intermediaries.
        
        0.9.16 (2010-05-03)
        ===================
        
         - If a server returns a 502 or 503 error code, lazr.restfulclient
           will retry its request a configurable number of times in hopes that
           the error is transient.
        
         - It's now possible to invoke lazr.restful destructor methods, with
           the lp_delete() method.
        
        0.9.15 (2010-04-27)
        ====================
        
         - Clients will no longer fetch a representation of a collection
           before invoking a named operation on the collection.
        
        0.9.14 (2010-04-15)
        ===================
        
         - Clients now send a useful and somewhat customizable User-Agent
           string.
        
         - Added a workaround for a bug in httplib2.
        
         - Removed the software dependency on lazr.restful except when running
           the full test suite. (The standalone_test test suite tests basic
           functionality of lazr.restfulclient to make sure the code base
           doesn't fundamentally depend on lazr.restful.)
        
        0.9.13 (2010-03-24)
        ===================
        
        - Removed some no-longer-needed compatibility code for buggy
          servers, and fixed the tests to work with the new release of simplejson.
        
        - The fix in 0.9.11 to avoid errors on eCryptfs filesystems wasn't
          strict enough. The maximum filename length is now 143 characters.
        
        0.9.12 (2010-03-09)
        ===================
        
        - Fixed a bug that prevented a unicode string from being used as a
          cache filename.
        
        0.9.11 (2010-02-11)
        ===================
        
        - If a lazr.restful web service publishes multiple versions, you can
          now specify which version to use in a separate constructor argument,
          rather than sticking it on to the end of the service root.
        - Filenames in the cache will never be longer than 150 characters,
          to avoid errors on eCryptfs filesystems.
        - Added a proof-of-concept test for OAuth-signed anonymous access.
        - Fixed comparisons of entries and hosted files with None.
        
        0.9.10 (2009-10-23)
        ===================
        
        - lazr.restfulclient now requests the correct WADL media type.
        - Made HTTPError strings more verbose.
        - Implemented the equality operator for entry and hosted-file resources.
        - Resume setting the 'credentials' attribute on ServerRoot to avoid
          breaking compatibility with launchpadlib.
        
        0.9.9 (2009-10-07)
        ==================
        
        - The WSGI authentication middleware has been moved from lazr.restful
          to the new lazr.authentication library, and lazr.restfulclient now
          uses the new library.
        
        0.9.8 (2009-10-06)
        ==================
        
        - Added support for OAuth.
        
        0.9.7 (2009-09-30)
        ==================
        
        - Added support for HTTP Basic Auth.
        
        0.9.6 (2009-09-16)
        ==================
        
        - Made compatible with lazr.restful 0.9.6.
        
        0.9.5 (2009-08-28)
        ==================
        
        - Removed debugging code.
        
        0.9.4 (2009-08-26)
        ==================
        
        - Removed unnecessary build dependencies.
        
        - Updated tests for newer version of simplejson.
        
        - Made tests less fragile by cleaning up lazr.restful example filemanager
          between tests.
        
        - normalized output of simplejson to unicode.
        
        0.9.3 (2009-08-05)
        ==================
        
        Removed a sys.path hack from setup.py.
        
        0.9.2 (2009-07-16)
        ==================
        
        - Fields that can contain binary data are no longer run through
          simplejson.dumps().
        
        - For fields that can take on a limited set of values, you can now get
          a list of possible values.
        
        0.9.1 (2009-07-13)
        ==================
        
        - The client now knows to look for multipart/form-data representations
          and will create them as appropriate. The upshot of this is that you
          can now send binary data when invoking named operations that will
          accept binary data.
        
        
        0.9 (2009-04-29)
        ================
        
        - Initial public release
